			<div>
				<p>Nowadays, due to the increased use of the internet and digitalization of many services, 
				the deployment and the use of web applications have increased. Since these web 
				applications are being used in almost all the domains, they have become a favorite 
				target to various attacks. In this paper we highlight one of the top most attacks in 
				modern web i.e Cross Site Scripting attack(XSS), which is also listed in the top 10 
				web vulnerabilities by OWASP and propose a model to mitigate XSS attacks [2]. XSS 
				is a code injection attack that allows an attacker to run malicious javascript code on 
				the victim's browser and as a result steal victim’s cookies, passwords, locations, credit 
				card numbers etc. We also discuss and analyse some of the recent work in this domain. 
				Based on the strengths and loopholes of the discussed mechanisms, we propose a 
				client side XSS detection model which is capable of handling some of the edge cases 
				in the previous models.</p>

			<h2 id="content__section1">1. Introduction</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In the modern society, with the monumental advancements in web technologies and 
					innovations like the internet of things, web applications have become a part and parcel 
					of the daily routines of people. As of January 2021 there were about 4.66 billion 
					active internet users I.e about 59.5% of the global population. Users avail different 
					services and connect with people over the internet. The data shared by the users not 
					only benefits different organizations for analyzing the data and improving the 
					customer experience but also fascinates the attackers to use the data for his/her selfish 
					motives.</p>
				<p>This paper addresses one such attack called Cross site scripting attack(XSS). 
					According to the Acunetix Web Application Vulnerability Report 2021,in 2020, 25% 
					of the web targets still had XSS vulnerabilities and this number is gradually increasing [1]. Cross site scripting comes within the sphere of code injection vulnerabilities. In this type of attack, an adversary injects a malicious javascript code through the input parameters on the client side. This code gets executed on the victim’s browser and performs harmful actions like cookie stealing, session token 
					theft and can also be used to launch other attacks. The XSS attack occurs because the 
					web developer oversees the need to place restrictions on the input character-set and 
					poor data validation, which then poses a serious security threat to the website and 
					clients in the future. These days HTML 5 has gained popularity for the purpose of 
					front-end development. The main objective of HTML 5 was to support multimedia 
					and improve the user experience.HTML5 contains many new features such as SVG, 
					Canvas, web storage, drag and drop,Geo-location, Communication API’s, new 
					attributes for tags and so on.</p>
				<p>Though HTML 5 takes advantage of new features in improving the user experience, it 
					simultaneously introduces new potential threats to users and websites. The existing 
					solutions to XSS detection make use of regular expression to detect the presence of 
					dynamic content and client side filtering mechanism[5]. The use of new technologies 
					like HTML 5 makes detecting XSS patterns harder and harder. Multitudinous defence 
					mechanisms are being put forward to mitigate this attack but the drawback of these 
					solutions is low fidelity and disallowing the execution of begin code. In this paper we 
					discuss an approach that uses a repository of blacklisted keywords instead of the 
					traditional regular expression matching</p>

			<div>
				<h3 id="content__section2.1">2.1 What is XSS?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Cross site scripting, abbreviated as XSS is a type of code injection attack in which an 
						attacker somehow injects judicially crafted javascript into a vulnerable web 
						applications. This evil script gets executed on the victim’s browser and the sensitive 
						data such as cookies, password, session tokens etc gets leaked to the attacker. XSS 
						attacks can be launched in 3 forms: they are stored XSS attacks, reflected XSS attacks 
						and DOM based XSS attacks.</p>
				</div>
				<h3 id="content__section2.2">2.2 Taxonomy of Cross Site Scripting</h3>
				<div>
					<h4 id="content__section2.2.1">2.2.1 Stored XSS:</h4>
					<div>
						<p>In this type of XSS attack the injected malicious script is sent back to the server of the 
							web application using an attack vector and is stored in the database.Whenever the 
							page that loads this stored malicious script is visited by a user the malicious script can 
							steal the passwords,cookies etc. of that user.This attack is also known as "Persistent 
							XSS" as the malicious script is stored in the database and attacks the user until it is 
							removed</p>
						<p>For example consider the scenario of commenting in an e-commerce website, if the 
							comment entered by the user is not sanitized or checked for malicious code as shown 
							in the fig.1 before sending to the server, this leads to stored XSS attack.Every time a 
							user visits the product page where the comment that contains the malicious script is 
							loaded,it affects the user in the form of stealing cookies,passwords etc</p>
					</div>
					<h4 id="content__section2.2.2">2.2.2 Reflected XSS:</h4>
					<div>
						<p>In this type of XSS attack the attacker manipulates the user to click a meticulously 
							crafted malicious link which affects the users browser by stealing cookies,session 
							tokens,passwords etc.The fig.2 explains the process of executing this attack.First the 
							attacker checks if the given website is vulnerable to XSS,if it is then the attacker uses 
							social engineering to manipulate the user to click the malicious link.Social 
							engineering means tricking the user by manipulating user to achieve a successful 
							conclusion of the attack [21].An example of Social engineering might be "Phishing 
							attack".</p>
						<p>Once the user clicks the link a request is sent to the website server which then reflects 
							back to the browser the malicious code of the attacker in the link.The browser 
							executes this malicious code on the users browser which transmits confidential user 
							information such as cookies,session tokens,passwords etc.to the attacker.</p>
					</div>
					<h4 id="content__section2.2.3">2.2.3 DOM based XSS:</h4>
					<div>
						<p>In this type of XSS the attackers malicious code is executed by changing the DOM of 
							the website on the client side.This code occurs as DOM rather than HTML format, eg: 
							document.URL, document.write etc.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3 id="content__section2.3">2.3 Basic techniques to mitigate XSS attacks</h3>
				<div>
					<b>1. Be specific about the inputs taken from the user:</b><br>
					<p>Filter the input based on what type of data you are looking for and what is valid.For 
						example - using the type attribute in the input tag is one such method to restrict the 
						user to get the type of data you want.</p>
					<b>2.Encoding untrusted data:</b><br>
					<p>Encoding untrusted data before injecting them into the allowed places in the code is 
						another way of mitigating XSS.For example, the characters such as <,>,(,) etc. can be 
						replaced with their HTML entities before injecting the html content so that the code 
						becomes inactive.</p>
					<b>3.Using Content security policy</b><br>
					<p>You can use Content security policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.The CSP only allows 
						scripts from the trusted domains which the developer specifies in the content-security 
						policy header, hence preventing any untrusted javascript from executing</p>
					<b>4.Using appropriate response headers:</b><br>
					<p>You can use headers such as content-type to prevent HTTP response that are not 
						considered to contain scripts.For example if the response should contain JSON then 
						we can set the content-type header as 'application/json'.</p>
					<b>5.Using trusted libraries:</b><br>
					<p>Using trusted libraries and updating them regularly can also decrease the 
						commencet of an XSS attack.</p>

			<h2 id="content__section3">Proposed Methodology</h3>
			<div>
				<p>In this section we present our model for mitigating Cross site scripting attacks.The model consists 		of the following major modules namely Input classifier,character encoder, javascript preprocessor 		and vulnerability tester.</p>
				<p>Initially the model collects the user inputs from all the form inputs in a web 
					application. The collected inputs are categorized into code input or plain form input 
					by the input classifier (This is specified by the web application developer). Plain form 
					inputs are not supposed to contain any code elements like <,>,”,& etc. Hence all the 
					special characters in the inputs that are classified as plain form inputs are simply 
					encoded into HEX codes by the character encoder. Once encoded these inputs are safe 
					and cannot launch any attacks.</p>
				<p>In case of inputs that accept code,it is tested for any malicious code by the 
					vulnerability tester.If it contains any harmful code, it prompts the user to re-enter the 
					input else forwards the request to the server.The working of the vulnerability tester is 
					as follows: Firstly all the encoded code is decode using a pre-processor, since 
					attackers these days write the attack vectors in encoded format so that they go 
					undetected by many XSS detection systems.Then the pre-processed inputs are 
					inspected word by word to check if they consist any potentially harmful keywords. 
					All the words in the input are compared against a XSS keyword repository. This XSS 
					keyword repository has the keywords such as onerror, onfocus, onclick etc which can 
					trigger the execution of javascript code. If any of the input has these keywords, the 
					input is rejected and treated invalid. Since the vulnerability tester detects any harmful 
					keywords, even if javascript code is injected into the input, it won’t be executed. Most 
					of the existing methods use pattern matching strategy that match the inputs against a 
					XSS repository with all the possible attack vector patterns and detect any XSS attack 
					vectors. But our method makes use of keyword matching, hence it has a greater chance of detecting a new attack vector, whose pattern is not yet registered in the 
					XSS repository. The following figure shows the flow of our model</p>

			<h2 id="content__section4">5. Conclusion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>In this paper, we discussed the term XSS attack and its types. We also took a look at 
					some of the proposed methodologies to detect and mitigate XSS attacks. From our 
					literature survey we understand many of the existing models use pattern matching to 
					detect XSS attack vectors. But the emergence of new technologies and adding of new 
					features, also result in new attack vectors, which can easily bypass many of the 
					existing models. The attackers these days, encode the input vectors which can go 
					undetected by any model which searches for patterns or any machine learning models 
					which were trained using decoded keywords. Therefore we propose a simple and 
					improvised XSS attack detection model which firstly pre-processes the inputs and 
					decodes any encoded content and then detects XSS inputs based on the keywords 
					instead of attack vector patterns. There are also black box models proposed for 
					detecting XSS vulnerabilities.But using these methods is not very effective as new 
					attack vectors are being discovered regularly and also might be overkill for small 
					applications.</p>
				<p>Looking at the related work we can also infer that most of the recent XSS detection 
					models use machine learning algorithms. Though machine learning algorithms can be 
					very effective in detecting XSS, most of the machine learning algorithms have 
					disadvantages such as high complexity, high training period, overfitting etc. Hence it 
					is better to use simple models for small applications which run on low configuration 
					devices. Having said that considering the advances in machine learning, the models 
					using ML algorithms have a promising future. Our model is an attempt to overcome 
					some edge cases. It can be further improved using better algorithms such as KMP forstring matching. The malicious keyword detection can be implemented using machine 
					learning for even better results.</p>
